        Rules

      <h3>
        The rules for the room are simple:
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Before asking a question here, ask it on 
          <a TARGET="_top" href="http://stackoverflow.com">
            Stack Overflow
          </a>
          or another 
          <a TARGET="_top" href="http://stackexchange.com">
            Stack Exchange
          </a>
          site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not fire off a question before you've researched your problem. Remember, 
          <a TARGET="_top" href="http://www.google.com">
            Google
          </a>
          is always your friend!
        </li>
        <li>
          Use English to the best of your ability and do not use chatspeak. Just try to make sense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Please don't bother ping spamming. This is the practice of constantly posting @username in order to annoy the person.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to limit inchat code to a reasonable amount. If you have lots of code to share, how about making a 
          <a TARGET="_top" href="https://gist.github.com/">
            gist
          </a>
          , or even a 
          <a TARGET="_top" href="https://github.com/new">
            repository
          </a>
          . You can also use pastebin, pastie and hastebin. If you post code, it will be removed from chat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't flag stuff unless it's obviously flagworthy. It just annoys whoever invalidates the flags and doesn't help anyone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not be a help vampire. This is, attempting to find help and lure attention onto your problems continuously where others show no clear interest in your problems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Don't be creepy, no racism, hate or severe swearwords! Let's be friendly!
        </li>
        <li>
          Remember this room has 
          <strong>
            no one topic
          </strong>
          and people are free to 
          <strong>
            talk about what they wish
          </strong>
          as long as it follows above rules and is loosely related to programming.
        </li>
        <li>
          Multi-line messages shall be treated as a crime in this chatroom.
        </li>
      </ul>
      These are all nonstrict and really we'll get along fine if you're not begging for code and help all the time. In other words, be excellent to each other.
